    text: `At NextGrowth Labs, Nitish reported directly to me. Nitish was selected after completing
vigorous assessments. On an average, 1 out of every 100 candidates pass these assessments.
<br/>
Nitish is a <b>remarkable software developer</b>. While designing and building solutions - he thinks
about both the user and the business logic. One of his best strengths is that he can learn
anything very quickly and implement it.
<br/>
He is focused and understands instructions quickly. He worked with other teams - like Marketing
and Operations to build solutions around it - and was able to build solutions with minimal
instructions.
<br/>
He is very <b>detail oriented</b>, and would occasionally come up with questions that would change
the scope of the project.
<br/>
He’s <b>responsible and dependable</b>. Even while leaving our organization, Nitish actively worked to
support transition, and created a roadmap to finish the process a week before the last day of
working - just so that he could get feedback and answer any questions about the projects from
his co-workers.
Our team is going to miss Nitish, but we know that he’d succeed wherever he goes.`,
